# Deep_Learning

## Description

Solution of deep learning projects.

### Lab 1-3 - Neural Networks, Convolutions and Pytorch



#### Problems and Solutions
- [Main Problem statement](lab1/report/lab1_statement.md), [Python code](lab1) and [report](lab1/report/lab1_report.pdf)
- Pen-and-Paper [theoretical assignment](lab1/report/penpaper_statement.pdf) and [solutions](lab1/report/penpaper_solutions.pdf)

#### Known Issues
Due to a bug the Tensorflow MLP test results are largely inflated. The code has been fixed, and the report will be updated soon.

### Lab 4 - Recurrent Neural Networks, Autoregressive LISTM



### Lab 5 - Generative Models
